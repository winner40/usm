Code your policies however you want and just include usm.h, while putting the resulting file inside impl/alloc (for the alloc. policies, only ones available for now).

make
sudo ./project-2 examples/project-2/cfg/alloc_policy_assignment_strategy.cfg
sudo LD_PRELOAD=./usmTagger ./littleTest 1000

Make's TBD at root.
Just the location of the config file is to be given.
littleTest's provided in the repo..
